# Movies-Data-Analysis
Movies Data Analysis Python

## Project Objective

This project focuses on analyzing movie data to uncover insights and trends. The primary goal is to identify correlations between various factors, such as movie budgets, genres, and box office revenues. Initially, the project involves cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and formatting issues. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted using visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand the relationships between variables. Correlation analysis quantifies how different attributes interact, helping to determine significant patterns. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn assist in visualization.
